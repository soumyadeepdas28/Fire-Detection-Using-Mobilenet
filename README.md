# Fire-Detection-Using-Mobilenet

Hello I am Soumyadeep Das,

In this project, I used TensorFlow Keras to create and train a deep learning model based on MobileNet, which is a lightweight and efficient architecture ideal for real-time applications. The pretrained MobileNet model was fine-tuned to better suit the task, boosting both accuracy and training efficiency. To monitor and analyze the training process, I used Weights & Biases (WandB) to follow experiments in real time, log metrics, and create useful visualizations. This approach shortened the training process and hastened model optimization.
